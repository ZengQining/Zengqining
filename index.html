        <h1>HDB Residents' Accessibility to Parks and Water Activities Areas</h1>

        <p><i>HDB Residents' Accessibility to Parks and Water Activities Areas</i> is a data visualization project that examines the accessibility of green and blue spaces for residents living in Singapore’s public housing estates. 
            <br><br> 
            The <i>storymap</i> leverages government open data to map the locations of parks, reservoirs, and designated water activity areas, calculating the walkshed of access within a 500-meter network distance for parks and water activity areas from all HDB flats in Singapore.
            <br><br>
            By highlighting gaps in accessibility, this project provides insights into how urban planning can enhance recreational equity and support Singapore’s vision of becoming a “City in Nature.”
